# Keylogger_Antikeylogger
This is a project containing Keylogger and Anti-Keylogger using Python Language.
It is likely that about one out of many large companies systematically monitors the computer, internet, or email use of its users employees. There are over hundredâ€™s different products available today that will let organizations see what their users do at work on their "personal" computers, in their email, and on the internet. keylogger (keystroke logging) is a type of surveillance software that once installed on a system, has the capability to record every keystroke made on that system. The recording is saved in a log file, usually encrypted.In this project we will make a keylogger which will be able to record all the keystrokes and gain all the information that is typed using a keyboard by the person.By this we will be able to monitor all the things that a person is using or surfing on his laptop.Since the keyloggers can also be used to steal information(can be in form of malware) , we will build a Anti-keylogger that will be able to detect whether there is a keylogger installed or running on the system.By making an anti-keylogger we will be able to monitor the information on our system is not been shared by anyone .
