# Keylogger_Antikeylogger
Implemented a keylogger to record keyboard inputs and an anti-keylogger system to detect and prevent unauthorized keystroke capture.
Technical Aspects: Developed the keylogger in a programming language like C++ or Python to capture keyboard inputs and store them in a secure file. Created the anti-keylogger using heuristic analysis and real-time monitoring to detect suspicious activities.
Technologies Used: Python, Heuristic Analysis, Real-time Monitoring.
Impact: Demonstrated an understanding of cybersecurity concepts, both in offensive and defensive strategies, contributing to improved security awareness.Implemented a keylogger to record keyboard inputs and an anti-keylogger system to detect and prevent unauthorized keystroke capture.
